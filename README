LAB PROJECT OF DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS 

Introduction
------------
The project aims to implement a distributed systems with three clients, three databases and a "middleware".
The middleware has three nodes and each nodes correspond to a database and a client.
Databases are simply replicas of each others and all databases contain 3 integer objects which are called A,B and C.
Clients cannot communicate directly to the databases. They have to communicate via middleware.
When client requests to read an object it tries to connect to local database.
When client requests to change an object all nodes communicate each other and change the all replicas of databases.
