LAB PROJECT OF DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS 

Introduction
------------
The project aims to implement a distributed systems with three clients, three databases and a "middleware".
The middleware has three nodes and each nodes correspond to a database and a client.
Databases are simply replicas of each others and all databases contain 3 integer objects which are called A,B and C.
Clients cannot communicate directly to the databases. They have to communicate via middleware.
When client requests to read an object it tries to connect to local database.
When client requests to change an object all nodes communicate each other and change the all replicas of databases.

Structure of Nodes
------------------
Each nodes consist of 3 parts, a sender and two receivers.
Sender of a node gets requests from the client and forwards to the one receiver of each other nodes.
all receivers communicate only one sender.

For example:
first receiver of first node communicates sender of second node
second receiver of first node communicates sender of third node
first receiver of second node communicates sender of first node
second receiver of second node communicates sender of third node
first receiver of third node communicates sender of second node
second receiver of third node communicates sender of first node

Initially sender checks the online nodes.
If there is at least one online node it locks all mutexes of local objects and take the informations and release the mutexs.
When initialization done it waits request from client.
When a sender gets a reading request it can handle locally.
It simply locks the mutex of corresponding objects then read the object and release the mutex.
When a sender gets a
